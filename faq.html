                        <h3>What types of video production services do you offer in Canada (corporate, events, commercials, social media)?</h3>
                        <p>AbsoluteCinema provides comprehensive video production services across Canada including corporate video production for training materials, company profiles, and executive communications. Our event videography covers conferences, product launches, galas, and corporate meetings with multi-camera setups and live streaming capabilities. We specialize in commercial video production for television, web advertising, and promotional campaigns. Additionally, we create social media content optimized for various platforms including Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube content, and LinkedIn business posts. Our services also include product demonstrations, brand storytelling videos, documentary-style content, and drone videography for aerial perspectives.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does cinematic video production cost in Canada, and what affects the price?</h3>
                        <p>Video production costs vary significantly based on project scope, duration, location, and complexity. Factors affecting pricing include crew size, equipment requirements, shooting days, travel distance, post-production complexity, and deliverable formats. A simple corporate interview might range from $2,000-$5,000, while a comprehensive commercial production could cost $10,000-$50,000 or more. Event coverage typically ranges from $1,500-$8,000 depending on duration and coverage requirements. Drone videography adds $500-$2,000 depending on flight time and complexity. We provide detailed quotes outlining all costs including pre-production planning, filming, editing, colour grading, audio enhancement, and final delivery in multiple formats.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you provide videography services in my province or city, and do you charge travel fees?</h3>
                        <p>We serve all Canadian provinces and territories with our video production services. Our primary coverage areas include major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Winnipeg. For locations within 100 kilometers of our base operations, travel costs are typically included in project quotes. For remote locations or multi-day shoots, we charge reasonable travel fees covering transportation, accommodation, and per diem expenses for crew members. We're experienced in working across Canada's diverse landscapes and weather conditions, ensuring professional results regardless of location. Remote areas may require additional planning time for equipment transport and logistics coordination.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How far in advance should I book a videographer for an event or commercial shoot?</h3>
                        <p>We recommend booking video production services 4-6 weeks in advance for optimal scheduling and preparation. Large events, commercial productions, or shoots requiring extensive pre-production should be booked 8-12 weeks ahead. This timeline allows for proper planning, location scouting, permit acquisition, script development, and equipment preparation. Rush projects can sometimes be accommodated with 1-2 weeks notice, though this may involve premium pricing and limited crew availability. Holiday seasons, conference periods, and summer months are particularly busy, so earlier booking is essential. Emergency or same-week bookings are possible but subject to crew availability and may incur rush fees.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is your typical turnaround time for editing and final delivery?</h3>
                        <p>Standard turnaround times vary by project complexity and deliverable requirements. Simple event highlights or corporate interviews typically require 1-2 weeks for editing and delivery. Complex commercial productions with motion graphics, colour grading, and multiple versions may take 3-4 weeks. Product videos and promotional content usually require 2-3 weeks for completion. Rush delivery is available for urgent projects with expedited fees. Our editing process includes rough cut review, client feedback incorporation, final cut approval, colour correction, audio enhancement, and format optimization. We provide regular updates throughout post-production and accommodate reasonable revision requests to ensure final satisfaction.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you offer 4K video, colour grading, and professional audio recording?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we provide full 4K video production capabilities using professional cinema cameras and high-quality lenses. Our equipment includes RED, Sony FX, and Canon cinema cameras capable of recording in various formats including 4K, 6K, and 8K resolutions. Professional audio recording utilizes wireless microphone systems, boom operators, and multi-track recording equipment ensuring broadcast-quality sound. Our post-production services include comprehensive colour grading using DaVinci Resolve and professional colour correction workflows.

                        <h3>Can you create short-form social media edits (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts) from one shoot?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely! We specialize in creating multiple content pieces from single shooting sessions, maximizing your investment and content library. From one production day, we can create long-form content for websites and presentations, plus numerous short-form edits optimized for different social media platforms. Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn posts, and Facebook content each require specific aspect ratios, durations, and engagement strategies. We understand platform-specific requirements including vertical formats, caption placement, and optimal video lengths. Our editing approach captures multiple angles and moments during filming specifically to support diverse content creation, ensuring you have engaging material for comprehensive social media campaigns.</p>

                        <h3>Who owns the footage and music licensing rights after the project is completed?</h3>
                        <p>Upon final payment, clients receive full ownership rights to all finished video content and raw footage captured during production. We provide comprehensive licensing that allows unlimited use across all platforms, territories, and time periods unless specifically negotiated otherwise. Music licensing depends on selections made during post-production. We can provide royalty-free music libraries, purchase specific track licenses, or work with original compositions as needed. All licensing costs are clearly outlined in project quotes. We maintain backup copies of projects for one year for revision purposes but do not retain usage rights. Clients receive all project files, raw footage, and documentation necessary for future editing or repurposing of content.</p>

                        <h3>Can you work with our marketing team and follow brand guidelines for a corporate video?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely! We excel at collaborating with internal marketing teams, advertising agencies, and brand managers to ensure video content aligns perfectly with established brand guidelines and marketing objectives.

                        <h3>What information do you need to provide an accurate quote (location, shoot length, deliverables)?</h3>
                        <p>To provide accurate project quotes, we need several key details about your video production requirements. Essential information includes project objectives and target audience, preferred shooting locations and accessibility, estimated shoot duration and crew requirements, desired deliverable formats and quantities, timeline and deadline requirements, budget range and approval process, and any specific technical requirements or brand guidelines. Additional helpful details include previous video examples you admire, key messaging points, talent or spokesperson requirements, equipment needs like drone footage or specialized lighting, and distribution plans for the finished content. The more detailed information you provide, the more accurate and comprehensive our quote will be.</p>

                        <h3>Do you offer revisions, and how many rounds of changes are included?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we include revision rounds in all video production projects to ensure final satisfaction with delivered content. Standard projects include two rounds of revisions: one after rough cut review and one after final cut presentation. Additional revision rounds can be accommodated for complex projects or specific client requirements. Our revision process includes detailed feedback collection, timeline estimates for implementing changes, and clear communication about scope modifications that might affect project costs. We encourage consolidated feedback from all stakeholders during each revision round to maintain efficient timelines. Minor adjustments like colour tweaks, audio levels, or text corrections are typically handled quickly, while major structural changes may require additional time and potentially additional costs depending on the extent of modifications required.</p>
